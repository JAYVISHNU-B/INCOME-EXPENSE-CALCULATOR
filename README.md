# INCOME-EXPENSE-CALCULATOR
# Income Expense Calculator

## Project Description

The **Income Expense Calculator** is a web application that helps users manage their finances by tracking income and expenses. Users can add entries, edit or delete them, and view the total income, total expenses, and overall balance. The app also provides filtering options to view all entries, income only, or expenses only.

This project implements basic **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality and uses **local storage** to persist data across sessions. It features a responsive design to ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Features

- **Add Entries**: Users can add new income or expense entries by specifying a description, amount, and type (income or expense).
- **View Entries**: All added entries are dynamically displayed in a list, showing the description, amount, and type.
- **Edit Entries**: Users can update an existing entry's details.
- **Delete Entries**: Entries can be deleted from the list.
- **Filter Entries**: Filter entries to view only income, only expenses, or all entries.
- **Totals**: The app calculates and displays total income, total expenses, and the net balance.
- **Data Persistence**: All entries are saved in the browser's local storage, so the data is available even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, making it functional on both desktops and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the layout of the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app and ensuring it is responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For handling all logic, including CRUD operations and local storage.
